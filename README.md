# Loans-In-Colorado
Repository for stuff from Springboard Capstone #1, a study of SBA loans in Colorado

The sequence of notebooks is as follows:

1) SBA_Capstone_Data_Wrangling.ipynb contains the initial data wrangling.

2) LIC_EDA_Plus_More_Wrangling.ipynb contains the final bit of data wrangling needed to make the dataset ready for models.

3) LIC_Classifier_Baseline_to_XGBoost.ipynb contains the variosu models trained and tested on the dataset. 

Other notebooks:

SBA_Capstone_Choropleths.ipynb contains examples of various dataset features plotted by county. This is just for visualization and not part of the eventual model.
